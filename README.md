# Role-Playing Game - FCC Practice Project
Introduction
This is a practice project designed to help you learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role-Playing Game (RPG). Throughout this project, you will work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. The game will involve creating characters, battling enemies, managing inventory, and exploring a fictional world.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure you have a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your computer. You'll also need a web browser to run and test your JavaScript code.

# Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in your preferred text editor or IDE.
Modify the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files as needed to build your RPG game.

# Project Structure
index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of your web page. You can define the layout, headings, buttons, and other elements here.
styles.css: The CSS file where you can style your HTML elements, including fonts, colors, margins, paddings, etc., to enhance the visual appearance of your game.
script.js: This is where you'll write your JavaScript code for implementing game logic, handling user interactions, managing characters and inventory, combat mechanics, and more.

## Game Features
Your RPG game may include the following features:

# Character Creation:
 Allow players to create their own characters with customizable attributes such as name, class, skills, etc.
# Combat System:
 Implement a turn-based or real-time combat system where characters can battle enemies using attacks, spells, items, etc.
# Inventory Management: 
Enable players to collect and manage items, weapons, armor, potions, and other equipment.
Quests and Storyline: Design quests, missions, or a storyline that players can follow to progress through the game and unlock new content.
NPC Interactions: 
Include non-playable characters (NPCs) that players can interact with for information, quests, trading, or other purposes.
Leveling and Progression:
 Implement a leveling system where characters can gain experience points (XP), level up, and improve their stats and abilities.

# How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the game.
Follow on-screen instructions to create a character, explore the game world, battle enemies, complete quests, and advance through the game.
Use the keyboard or mouse to navigate menus, select actions, manage inventory, and interact with NPCs.
